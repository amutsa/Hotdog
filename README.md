Technologies used: Visual Studio code as the code editor.
                   Live SASS Compiler for watching my sass code and updating the css file.
                   Adobe photo shop.

So first I used adobe photo shop to slice my images and then I used Visual Studio Code as my code IDE editor. I use Live SASS Compiler which is an extension of Visual Studio code for watching my sass code and updating the css file .                   
Basically I tried to kept things simple,  not to many routes. I used sass file for editing and then it automatically converts it to css file.
There is only two sass files, I could have split my sass code into many section but because of time I let it in two files main.scss and responsiveMedia.scss. The watching of files helped to built it mobile first approach. I used google chrome for testing that is F12 deverlopes tools.

To Load the program click on the Html file and then hit F12 for developers tool. There you can choose any screen media you prefer. thank you. for any question on how to start it up you can reach me at 614 218 4480.
